Place the three app screenshots in this folder with the following names so the main `README.md` can render them:

- `dashboard.png` — Dashboard overview with stats and quick actions
- `rooms_list_1.png` — Rooms list screenshot (white cards)
- `rooms_list_2.png` — Rooms list screenshot (alternate crop)

How to add screenshots
----------------------
1. Save the images from your device or attachments.
2. Move or copy them into this folder and rename as above.

Example macOS `mv` command (adjust source paths):

```bash
mv ~/Downloads/dashboard.png docs/screenshots/dashboard.png
mv ~/Downloads/rooms_list_1.png docs/screenshots/rooms_list_1.png
mv ~/Downloads/rooms_list_2.png docs/screenshots/rooms_list_2.png
```

After adding the images, open the repository on GitHub or view the `README.md` locally to confirm the images render.
